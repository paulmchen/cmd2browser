## Install Prerequisites

Install Python (v3) and PIP:
1. Visit https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-18-04/ to learn how to instll Python
1. Visit https://www.shellhacks.com/python-install-pip-mac-ubuntu-centos/ to learn how to instqll PIP
1. Run the following commands to install Python flask and PYyaml modules:  

```shell
  pip install flask
  pip install PYyaml
```

## Install and Launch the App
1. Download the code

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/paulmchen/cmd2browser.git
```

2. Go to /cmd2browser folder and Launch the app

```shell
  python app.py
```

## Verify
1. Start a browser session and use the following URL to validate examples provided

```shell
  1. http://127.0.0.1:5000/ls/
  2. http://127.0.0.1:5000/docker_ps/
```

## Tips
- When you are connecting to the server from another client IP, you would need to add your client IP address to the white list in `config/config.yaml`. By default, the server will reject any non-local connections from any remote clients. Modify the following line by adding your client IP address to the white list of the server:
```shell
  ip_whitelist: '[''192.168.1.2'', ''192.168.1.3'', ''127.0.0.1'']'
```
- To add a new command line call and then send its output to a web browser, you can create a new def function in app.py. For example, to call a system command "kubectl get pods", add the following 'def' to app.py:
```shell
  @app.route('/kc_pods/')
  def get_kc_pods():
      try:
          return command.run("kubectl get pods")
      except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
          return message.error_500_msg
```
- To support a command that may not return results immediately, you can use `exec_command_async` function instead.
`exec_command_async` takes 2 input parameters. The first parameter is the command that you want to run, for example, `top`, the 2nd parameter `exec_time_in_seconds` is the elapse time to indicate how long it needs to wait in seconds before the browser session should resume to fetch outputs and then terminate the process of the command. Note: ensure that you set a proper value of the  `exec_time_in_seconds` to avoid from command process being terminated before it is completed. 
```shell
  # Example: call async command, e.g. top
  @app.route('/top/')
  def get_top():
      try:
          return command.run_async("top", 2)
      except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
          return message.error_500_msg
```

Launch the following URL to verify your new command line execution from your favourite browser:
```shell
http://127.0.0.1:5000/kc_pods/
```
